Hi I am Crystina, a current MMath (Master of Mathematics) student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca),
supervised by <!-- <span style="color:blue">[Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html)</span>. -->
[Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).
I received my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home).
I was an research intern at Max Planck Institut für Informatik and NAVER (네이버),
and exchanged to University of California, Los Angelas and University of Waterloo during my undergraduate.

My current research interests lies under the intersection between Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing,
especially targeting on data efficiency.
